  Note: Please ensure you have installed <code><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs</a></code>
## Step 1: Install NPM Modules

To preview and run the project on your device:

Open project folder in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
